## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

Vehicle length (p-value = 5.08e-08)and ground clearance (p-value = 5.21e-08) provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values. 
The R-squared was 0.6825, the strength of correlation was moderate, so the slope fo the linear model is considered to be zero. 
 The p-value of this linear model was smaller than 0.05 (5.35e-11), therefore ti predicts mpg effectively.

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils

The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch. Does the current manufacturing data meet this design specification for all manufacturing lots in total and each lot individually? Why or why not?

## T-Tests on Suspension Coils

briefly summarize your interpretation and findings for the t-test results. Include screenshots of the t-test to support your summary.
