## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

Vehicle length (p-value = 5.08e-08)and ground clearance (p-value = 5.21e-08) provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values. 
The R-squared was 0.6825, the strength of correlation was moderate, so the slope fo the linear model is considered to be zero. 
 The p-value of this linear model was smaller than 0.05 (5.35e-11), therefore ti predicts mpg effectively.

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils

### Total Summary Table
![total_summary](/image/total_summary.png)

As shown in the total_summary table, the variance for the whole manufacturing line  is 62.29356, so the current manufacturing data meet the design specification in total.
 
 ### Lot Summary Table
 ![lot_summary](/image/lot_summary.png)

As shown above, the variance for lot 1 and 2 are 0.9795918 and 7.4693878 respectively, so both lots meet the design specification. However, the variance for lot 3 is 170.2861224 and it is greater than 100, so the data for lot 3 cannot meet the design specification.
